## Overview
Beyond basic dynamic pricing - multi-objective optimization

What to build:
- Price elasticity modeling (how demand changes with price)
- Competitive pricing analysis (scrape/simulate competitor prices)
- Inventory-aware pricing (perishable goods, time-decay)
- Multi-armed bandit for price testing
- Show: "Increased revenue by X% vs fixed pricing strategy"

Why it matters: Works for e-commerce, SaaS, food-tech, travel

Tech stack: Python, scikit-learn, optimization libraries (scipy.optimize, PuLP)
