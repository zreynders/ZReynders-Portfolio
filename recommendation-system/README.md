# Recommendation System
_Zachary Reynders - 15/11/2025_

## Requirements
1. Build a recommendation system for mutliple profiles that can run locally on a low-end PC or macbook.
2. The model should return new results within 200 milliseconds.
3. The model should be optimised to increased engagement (don't let the user get bored).
4. A second model should learn the "mood" of the user, essentially creating different recommendation systems and detecting which one to use at the time.
5. Keep track of the "watched" stuff and don't recommend it again. If it is partially watched it can be surfaced when their "mood" is decided, but only if they havenn't ignored it multiple times.
6. Keep a history of "watched" content.
7. Upload the user's data to the cloud fully encoded, it should only be possible for them to access it.
8. Let the user decide what they want to spend their time doing (Reach certain goals of type of content watched vs other content).
